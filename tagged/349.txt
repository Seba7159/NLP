Assembly problems arise when a robot with relatively few degrees of actuated
freedom is assigned to manipulate an environment with relatively  many
degrees of unactuated freedom</sentence>. <sentence>This talk reviews our progress in the
effort to pose and solve classes of such problems within a framework of
"autonomous machine design" that emphasizes the dynamical nature of
robot tasks and environments</sentence>.</paragraph>

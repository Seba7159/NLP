   It  has been five years since I stopped working on <speaker>Andrew</speaker>, so the freedom
   of information act -- along with the passing from power of several people
   --  allows  me  to  tell  some  candid stories about it. <sentence>In 1983, the ITC
   started and grew to about 30 people</sentence>. <sentence>Eight were IBMers, ten  or  so  were
   newly  minted  Ph.D.s  from  our  very  own  department</sentence>. <sentence>We built <speaker>Andrew</speaker>,
   partially in the model of Spice and the Alto  system</sentence>.  <sentence>It  achieved  some
   real  successes  but  didn't accomplish all that we'd hoped</sentence>.  <sentence>Much of the
   problem was intrinsic to the way the world is, compared to how we thought
   it   was</sentence>.   <sentence>I   often  meet  people  who  still  have  some  of  my  1982
   misperceptions</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph>   I will reconsider some of the early,  crucial  decisions  of  the  <speaker>Andrew</speaker>
   project  related  to  wiring,  protocols, workstations, file systems, and
   software. <sentence>I'll assess the impact of <speaker>Andrew</speaker> on education and discuss  what
   IBM  and  CMU  ultimately  got  out  of  it</sentence>.  <sentence>I will argue that UNIX, the
   Macintosh, and Electronic Mail will not survive to the next century</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph>   Finally, I'll offer eight opinions that computer scientists  who  venture
   into the real world should consider:</paragraph>

      1. <sentence>Slowness Kills</sentence>.

      2. <sentence>Big, integrated systems lose</sentence>.

      3. <sentence>Virtual << Real</sentence>.

      4. <sentence>Programmer productivity is not so important</sentence>.

      5. <sentence>Technology transfer rarely works</sentence>.

      6. <sentence>Engineers don't buy; they log roll</sentence>.

      7. <sentence>Industrial funding is difficult</sentence>.

      8. 2nd System < 1st System < 3rd System.
